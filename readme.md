# The Up Goer 5 Sublime Text Word Set!!!

...or really any word set

this idea was taken from [The Up Goer 5 Text Editor](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/) (which should really be called "The Up Goer 5 Word Writer" or some such...)  All this is, is a small word set that will show you if what you are writing is not one of the ten hundred most often used words.  The only problem is that you can yourself add words to the word set by pressing the right side push thing and pick "Ignore".  There is no way I can stop this from happening, so be watching what you do!
